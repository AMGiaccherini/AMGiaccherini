# Hi there! 👋

I'm <b>[Andrea](https://amgiaccherini.github.io/amgiaccherini-website/)</b>, a software and web developer based in Italy.

I generally like to start some big project to make some task easier.

I usually work alone on projects, but I don't mind working in a team.

My main language are <b>Java</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>Unreal Engine</b>, but I also use <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JS</b>, <b>PHP</b> and <b>SQL</b> for web works.

I'm really proud of my recent work: <b>[DailyObjectives](https://github.com/AMGiaccherini/DailyObjectives)</b>.

I'm currently working on a singleplayer, survivalhorror with some sound mechanics, alone.

If you want to help me built it just know I don't have money to compensate you with ahah.

<b>Fun Facts:</b>
- I'm dischromatic (a lighter version of color blindness)
- I don't know how to swim
- I like to learn new language when I'm not working on a project
- <b>Hobbies</b>: anime, videogames, gym, traveling
