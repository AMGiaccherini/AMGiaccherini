# 💫 About Me:

I'm <b>[Andrea](https://amgiaccherini.github.io/amgiaccherini-website/)</b>, a software and web developer based in Italy.

I generally like to start some big project to make some task easier.

I usually work alone on projects, but I don't mind working in a team.

I'm really proud of my recent work: <b>[DailyObjectives](https://github.com/AMGiaccherini/DailyObjectives)</b>.

I'm currently working on a singleplayer, survivalhorror with some sound mechanics, alone.

If you want to help me built it just know I don't have money to compensate you with ahah.
